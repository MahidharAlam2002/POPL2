# CS2433: POPL2 Mini Assignment 2: Large Code Bases and OOP
# REPORT (CS19BTECH11046)

## INTRODUCTION :
The report just gives a brief idea about the clang/LLVM code base, the design decisions involved in it, the design patterns involved in it, the classes hierarcy, c++11 and c++14 features used in the code base, iterators and the data structures used in it.

## OOP and design decisions for LLVM :
In general for a programmer, to know the design decision, one should know about the requriements, design so far and the technology available to implement his ideas. Coming to the OOP design decisions, the base code have a huge number of classes involved. The complex hierarchy of classes of the base code clearly indicates this. So, classes of similiar features are group together such as the top class, the value class etc to simplify the design decision of the base code such that the base code or its design decision can be easily upadted if wanted to, in the future years. The crucial difference between the clang and the other compilers is the dependence of clang design on LLVM and LLVM IR at the optimizer stage of the compiler (in between front end and back end of the compilers). Then the entire code is diveded into serveral pieces as modules and used in each other if required, as header files.


## C++11 features used are :
Bcc32c, bcc32x (which are compilers for Win32, clang enhanced) uses most of the features of ISO c++11 standard. Initialisation of class objects by rvalues, atomic operators etc are among the standard c++11 features that are supported by the older clang models. The previous models of the clang partially used BCCIOSARM, BCCIOSARM64 such as lambda expressions, static asserstions multi-dectalator auto, variaidc templates etc among the core c++11 features. BCC32 (clang-enhanced compiler) as well supports the features such as Explicit conversion operators, extern Templates, strongly typed enums, forward declaration of enums etc.

## C++14 features used are :
The compilers of Win32, Win64 of the windows (clang enhanced compilers) uses most of the ISO c++14 standard.Return type deduction with auto, variable templates, lambdas with genric parameters etc.


## ITERATORS AND OWN DATA STRUCTURES USED :
Huge number of iterators are used in the code base. The following are a few crucial and important list of iterators used in the clang/llvm code base:
- Cllvm::AllocationOrder::Iterator
- llvm::ImmutableGraph< NodeValueT, EdgeValueT >::NodeSet::iterator
- llvm::OnDiskChainedHashTable< Info >::iterator
- Cllvm::ImmutableGraph< NodeValueT, EdgeValueT >::EdgeSet::iterator
-  Cllvm::ImmutableList< T >::iterator
- Cllvm::detail::DenseSetImpl< ValueT, MapTy, ValueInfoT >::Iterator

##### The data structures used in code base are:
- The own created data structures are created drawing inspiration from Arrays, vectors, queues, lists, sets, maps etc
- All of these were used not in the traaditional way, but with a few changes to them.
- Data structures like heaps, queues were also used i.e. just make your own data structure that fucntions like the original one but with custom new features added by the developers.
- Like hash_set, Uniquevecotr, Setvector, heap allocated arrays, arrays(general arrays), general vectors, sets, sorted vectors etc are used in the clang/llvm code base.


## CLASS HIERARCHY :
Writing the each and every class involved in clang and explaining in detail the class hierarchy takes much more time and is not easy to explain, hence a few crucial and important classes were taken and class hierarchy is written which gives the brief idea of the class hierarchy of the clang/LLVM code base.
OVERALL THE HIERARCHY OF SOME CLASSES OF CLANG/LLVM CODE BASE CAN BE WRITTEN AS:
The type class
the module class
the value class 
the user class 
the instruction class
the constant class
the globalvalue class
the fucntion class
the globalvariable class
the basicblock class
the argument class
Type class is the top most and the head of the all other classes present in the clang/llvm code base.
The type class is not derived from any other, that is, it is the top class for all other classes which are sub classes of the derived type such as integer type, array type, vector type, pointer type etc.
The next class is module class followed by the value class which contains a large number of sub classes in it such as follows, user class whcih in turn contains instruction class and the constant class which contian global value class which has both the function class and global variable class. Now apart from the user class, the value class also contains the basicblock class and the argument class in it. As a result the proper way of writing the hierarchy of classes can be written as follows :
- The Type class
- The Module class
- The Value class
- - The User class
- - - The Instruction class
- - - The Constant class
- - - - The GlobalValue class
- - - - - The Function class
- - - - - The GlobalVariable class
- - The BasicBlock class
- - The Argument class

 
## DESIGN PATTERNS :
In general the concept of design patterns concpept is related to software engineering area of CSE. Among all the design patterns of 'Gang of 4 design patterns' which is also termed as GOF (named after 4 authors who were poineers of design patterns) observer pattern, factory pattern, visitor pattern, abstract factory pattern, template pattern, iterator pattern etc are used.
##### Observor pattern : 
Examples: Livevariables+Observer.
##### Factory pattern :
Examples: AttributeFactory, BasicValueFactory, FrontendActionFactory and so on.
##### Abstract Factory pattern :
Examples: FrontendActionFactory
##### Visitor pattern:
Examples: GetEdgesVisitor, GetTargetValueVisitor etc
